Surf’s Up

Lawson Rudd, an 18-year-old local entrepreneur, is the owner of Surf’s Up, a food truck specializing in snow cones.  Her food truck is normally located at the Band Stand by the Family Fun Center in Jackson and serves snow cones throughout the summer months.
Lawson asked us to create a website for her that would inform the Jackson community about her business and allow customers to order snow cones online.  She is hoping that this convenience will grow her business. 
Lawson already had a Surf’s Up logo.  We modified the logo just a bit by adding a truck design and chose the color pallette for the site by taking colors from the logo.
We are especially excited about the online order feature of the website.  Customers will now be able to see the Surf’s Up menu and order from their digital device.  By the time they arrive at the truck, their snow cones will be ready!
